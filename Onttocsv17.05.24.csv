http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/bmo.owl/BMO_0000118,"'Apparent Fiber Density (AFD) is a metric derived from diffusion MRI (dMRI) data, particularly from high-angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) or diffusion spectrum imaging (DSI). It quantifies the density of axons within a specific region of interest or white matter pathway in the brain. AFD is calculated based on the orientation distribution functions (ODFs) obtained from dMRI data. It reflects the density of axons within the imaging voxel and provides information about the microstructural integrity of white matter tracts.'	'generated with ChatGPT version 3,5 on 07.05.2024'",
http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/bmo.owl/BMO_0000119,"'Fractional Anisotropy (FA) is a metric derived from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique used to study the microstructural organization of tissues, particularly white matter in the brain. FA quantifies the degree of anisotropy of water diffusion within tissue. In white matter, water molecules tend to diffuse more easily along the direction of the fiber tracts (axonal bundles) than perpendicular to them. FA values range from 0 to 1, where higher values indicate greater directionality or organization of the tissue microstructure, typically reflecting intact white matter tracts.'",
http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/bmo.owl/BMO_0000120,"'Amyloid deposition refers to the accumulation of amyloid proteins, specifically amyloid-beta (AÎ²) peptides, in various tissues and organs throughout the body. In the context of neuroscience and neuroimaging, amyloid deposition commonly refers to the accumulation of AÎ² plaques in the brain, which is a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and some other neurodegenerative disorders.
In AD, abnormal accumulation of AÎ² peptides leads to the formation of plaques, which disrupt neuronal function and contribute to neurodegeneration. Imaging techniques such as positron emission tomography (PET) using radioligands targeting AÎ² can detect and quantify amyloid deposition in the brain.'",
http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/bmo.owl/BMO_0000121,"'Tau deposition refers to the accumulation of abnormal tau protein aggregates in the brain, which is a characteristic feature of several neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), and certain forms of Parkinson's disease (PD), among others.
In neuroimaging, techniques such as positron emission tomography (PET) using radioligands targeting tau can visualize and quantify tau deposition in the brain. These imaging methods enable researchers and clinicians to detect the presence of abnormal tau aggregates and assess their distribution and severity.'",
http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/bmo.owl/BMO_0000122,"'Mean diffusivity (MD) is a metric derived from diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) data. It quantifies the average magnitude of water molecule diffusion within a particular tissue or region of interest.
MD is calculated based on the diffusion tensor, which characterizes the rate and directionality of water diffusion in tissue. Unlike fractional anisotropy (FA), which measures the degree of diffusion directionality, MD represents the overall magnitude of diffusion regardless of direction.'",
